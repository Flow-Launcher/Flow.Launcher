## A history of the flow
Flow's roots came from a rebrand of the [JJW24/Wox fork](https://github.com/jjw24/Wox/issues/156) and WoX.

A big thank you and all credits to [Bao](https://github.com/bao-qian), the author of WoX, and its contrbutors for all the amazing work.

The JJW24/Wox fork started adding new changes on top of main WoX repo's code base from release v1.3.524. Flow is a continuation of the work from JJW24/Wox
