Windows may complain about security due to code not being signed, this will be completed at a later stage. If you downloaded from this repo, you are good to continue the set up. 

### Usage
- Open flow's search window: <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> is the default hotkey.
- Open context menu: on the selected result, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>/<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>.
- Cancel/Return to previous screen: <kbd>Esc</kbd>.
- Install/Uninstall/Update plugins: in the search window, type `pm` `install`/`uninstall`/`update` + the plugin name.
- Type `flow user data` to open your saved user settings folder. They are located at:
  - If using roaming: `%APPDATA%\FlowLauncher`
  - If using portable, by default: `%localappdata%\FlowLauncher\app-<VersionOfYourFlowLauncher>\UserData` 
- Type `open log location` to open your logs folder, they are saved along with your user settings folder.
