Flow's roots came from a rebrand of the [JJW24/Wox fork](https://github.com/jjw24/Wox/issues/156) and [WoX](https://github.com/Wox-launcher/Wox).

A big thank you and all credits to [Bao](https://github.com/bao-qian), the author of WoX, and its contributors for all the amazing work.

The JJW24/Wox fork started adding new changes on top of main WoX repo's code base from release v1.3.524.
Flow is a continuation of the work from JJW24/Wox.
